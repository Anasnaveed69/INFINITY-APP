Project Overview
The Social Network Application is a desktop-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to simulate a simplified version of a social media platform. It allows users to interact with posts, pages, friends, and memories in a structured and object-oriented manner. The application emphasizes clean design, separation of concerns, and adherence to best practices in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

This project is divided into two phases:

Phase I - Project Design : UML class diagram creation.
Phase II - Development : Implementation of the application with all required functionalities.
Features
Core Functionalities
Set Current User :
Allows the user to set themselves as the current user of the application.
View Home :
Displays posts from friends and liked pages shared in the last 24 hours.
Like a Post :
Enables users to like posts (up to 10 likes per post).
View Liked List :
Displays the list of users who have liked a specific post.
Comment on a Post :
Allows users to comment on posts (up to 10 comments per post).

Memory Posts : Special type of post that references an original post.
Dynamic Memory Allocation : All arrays are dynamically allocated to optimize memory usage.
Persistent Data Storage : User and page information is stored in .txt files for persistence.
Phases of Development
Phase I: Project Design
UML Class Diagram :
Created using tools like StarUML or Draw.io.
Includes all major classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.
Excludes getters, setters, and constructors for clarity.
Phase II: Development
Implementation :
Full development of the application with all required functionalities.
Proper folder structuring and modular codebase.
Adherence to OOP principles and best practices.
Execution Flow
Entry Point :
The application starts with the SocialNetworkApp::Run() function in the main() method.
Responsibilities are delegated to appropriate classes for separation of concerns.
Manager/App Class :
Acts as the master/driver class for the application.
Handles user input and delegates tasks to other classes.
Dynamic Memory Management :
Arrays are dynamically allocated and deallocated to ensure efficient memory usage.
Persistence :
User and page information is stored in .txt files for runtime persistence.
