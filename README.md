1.Project Overview
<br>
The Social Network Application is a desktop-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to simulate a simplified version of a social media platform. It allows users to interact with posts, pages, friends, and memories in a structured and object-oriented manner. The application emphasizes clean design, separation of concerns, and adherence to best practices in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
This project is divided into two phases:
<br>
Phase I - Project Design : UML class diagram creation.
<br>
Phase II - Development : Implementation of the application with all required functionalities.
<br>

<br>
Dynamic Memory Allocation : All arrays are dynamically allocated to optimize memory usage.
<br>
Persistent Data Storage : User and page information is stored in .txt files for persistence.
<br>
<br>
Phases of Development
<br>
Phase I: Project Design
<br>
UML Class Diagram :
<br>
Created using tools like StarUML or Draw.io.
Includes all major classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.
Excludes getters, setters, and constructors for clarity.
<br>
Phase II: Development
<br>
Implementation :
<br>
Full development of the application with all required functionalities.
<br>
Proper folder structuring and modular codebase.
<br>
Adherence to OOP principles and best practices.
<br>
Execution Flow
<br>
Entry Point :
<br>
The application starts with the SocialNetworkApp::Run() function in the main() method.
Responsibilities are delegated to appropriate classes for separation of concerns.
<br>
Manager/App Class :
<br>
Acts as the master/driver class for the application.
Handles user input and delegates tasks to other classes.
<br>
Dynamic Memory Management :
<br>
Arrays are dynamically allocated and deallocated to ensure efficient memory usage.
<br>
Persistence :
<br>
User and page information is stored in .txt files for runtime persistence.
<br>

Setup Instructions
<br>
Prerequisites
<br>
C++ Compiler : Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Clang).
<br>
Build Tools : Install make or any build system if required.
<br>
